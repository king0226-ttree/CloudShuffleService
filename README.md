# Cloud Shuffle Service test

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202-blue)](https://github.com/bytedance/ByteX/blob/master/LICENSE)

Cloud Shuffle Service(CSS) is a general purpose remote shuffle solution for compute engines, including Spark/Flink/MapReduce.
It provides reliable, high-performance, and elastic data shuffling capabilities to these compute engines.
Shuffled data is pushed to the CSS cluster, stored in disk or HDFS, and can be fetched from the CSS cluster by compute engines.

![CSS Architecture](docs/img/css-arch.png)
- CSS Worker 

  Stores shuffled data that is pushed from map tasks in memory and persist them to file system asynchronously, allowing reduce tasks to subsequently fetch data from CSS workers.

- CSS Master
  
  CSS Master is a coordinator component for an application's shuffle process, and is integrated into the application. It reads CSS worker list from ZooKeeper and assigns them to the application to do shuffling, tracks the progress of running map tasks, and then notifies CSS workers to commit files after all the map tasks have finished.

- CSS Client

  Map/Reduce task use CSS client to push/fetch shuffled data to the assigned CSS workers.

## Building CSS

### mvn build

CSS is built using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). Building CSS using Maven requires Java 8 and either Scala 2.12 or Scala 2.11.

```bash
mvn -DskipTests clean package
```
### Building a Runnable Distribution
To create a CSS distribution, use ./build.sh in the project root directory.
```bash
./build.sh
```
It generates a tgz package, you can copy it to the nodes you want to deploy CSS.
```
css-1.0.0-bin

├── docs

└── sbin
```

## Deploy CSS Cluster
CSS provides two deployment modes, standalone and zookeeper mode.
The standalone mode is currently only for testing,
while the zookeeper mode is used in the production environment.

1. Place the above built CSS tgz file on each node of the Cluster.
2. Unpack it to a dir, which can be set to CSS_HOME environment, all default conf, metrics and workers list can be found in the ```$CSS_HOME/conf``` directory.
3. Update ```$CSS_HOME/sbin/css-config.sh```.
   ```
   # standalone mode
   CSS_MASTER_HOST=<HOST_IP>
   MASTER_JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx8192m"
   WORKER_JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx8192m -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=100000m"
    
   # zookeeper mode
   WORKER_JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx8192m -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=100000m"
   ```
4. Update ```$CSS_HOME/conf/css-defaults.conf```
   ```
   css.cluster.name = <css cluster name>

   # standalone(for testing) or zookeeper(for production)
   css.worker.registry.type = zookeeper
   # only for zookeeper mode
   css.zookeeper.address = <ip1>:<port1>,<ip2>:<port2>,<ip3>:<port3>
   
   # css worker common conf
   css.flush.queue.capacity = 4096
   css.flush.buffer.size = 128k
   css.network.timeout = 600s
   css.epoch.rotate.threshold = 1g
   css.push.io.numConnectionsPerPeer = 8
   css.push.io.threads = 128
   css.replicate.threads = 128
   css.fetch.io.threads = 64
   css.fetch.chunk.size = 4m
   css.shuffle.server.chunkFetchHandlerThreadsPercent = 400
   
   # hdfs storage
   css.hdfsFlusher.base.dir = hdfs://xxx
   css.hdfsFlusher.num = -1
   css.hdfsFlusher.replica = 2    
   
   # local disk storage
   css.diskFlusher.base.dirs = /data00/css,/data01/css
   css.disk.dir.num.min = 1
   ```
5. Define your metrics and worker node host in the following files:
   ```
   $CSS_HOME/conf/css-metrics.properties
   $CSS_HOME/conf/workers
   ```
6. Sync all the updated config files to each node of the Cluster.
7. Start the CSS Cluster Shuffle workers. The script will ssh into each css worker node and start the Workers.
   ```
   # standalone mode
   cd $CSS_HOME;bash ./sbin/start-all.sh
   # zookeeper mode
   cd $CSS_HOME;bash ./sbin/start-workers.sh
   ```

## Running with Spark
1. Copy ```$CSS_HOME/client/spark-${version}/*.jar``` to ```$SPARK_HOME/jars/``` .
2. Run spark with CSS.
   ```
   # standalone mode
   --conf spark.css.cluster.name=<css cluster name> \
   --conf spark.css.master.address=css://<masterIp>:<masterPort>\
   --conf spark.shuffle.manager=org.apache.spark.shuffle.css.CssShuffleManager\
   
   # zookeeper mode
   --conf spark.css.cluster.name=<css cluster name> \
   --conf spark.css.zookeeper.address="<ip1>:<port1>,<ip2>:<port2>,<ip3>:<port3>" \
   --conf spark.shuffle.manager=org.apache.spark.shuffle.css.CssShuffleManager\
   ```

## Spark Adaptive Query Execution Support
CSS supports all the features of AQE. To support skew join optimization, it is necessary to patch the file to Spark and re-build Spark.
```
./patch/spark-3.0-aqe-skewjoin.patch
```

## Configuration
### CSS Cluster Server
